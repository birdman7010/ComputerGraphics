HW 2: Creating a 3D Scene

Jesse Bird

You can alternate between the Orthogonal and perspective modes with the arrow keys and other key bindings to
manipulate the projection views. If you press the f key you can then switch into the first person camera
which allows for manipulating the camera in this first person projection.

This scene is meant to recreate an aircraft landing and takeoff with an ATC tower.

I spent about 11 hours on this assignment, a vast majority of the time was getting the first
person view to work properly between the modes.
