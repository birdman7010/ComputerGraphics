HW 3: Textures and Lighting

Jesse Bird

This scene is meant to recreate an aircraft landing and takeoff with an ATC tower.

I spent about 20 hours on this assignment, a vast majority of the time was
getting the lighting to work and to get some of the textures to wrap correctly.

There is adaptation from class example 15.
